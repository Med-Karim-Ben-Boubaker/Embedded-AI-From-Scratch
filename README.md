# Neural-Network-From-Scratch
This project is a documentation on how to build your own neural network from scratch.

## Documentation

the [docs](docs/documentation.md) folder contains all the documentation about the theory and the thinking process behind creating the neural network. It contains simple explainations 
about fundamental topic such as forwardprobagation, backpropagation, layers, neurons, activation functions etc...

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Med-Karim-Ben-Boubaker/Neural-Network-From-Scratch.git
    cd Neural-Network-From-Scratch
```
2. Create a virtual environment

```sh
    python -m venv myenv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment

On windows:

```sh
myenv\Scripts\activate
```
On macOS and Linux:

```sh
source myenv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the required packages
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
